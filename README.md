# What is Earth Dollar?
------------------------
The Earth Dollar is
a Decentralized
Living Economic System
Based on the Preservation
of All Life on Our Planet

Earth Dollar is also an asset backed complementary currency designed to fight climate change, using a modified and enhanced version of Ethereum. The Earth Dollar acts as digital-fuel for powering transactions on its software platform known as the Mother Earth Network.

The Earth Dollar derives its value from monetizing untapped resources, such as natural capital assets to protect Mother Earth. Some of the assets backing the Earth Dollar come from World Heritage Sanctuaries setup as Global Commons, where the people of the world will collectively engage in protecting the wildlife sanctuaries.

The Earth Dollar is made up of 3 major components: (a) Fuel: The “Earth Dollar” as the fuel for social change; (b) Economic Engine: The “Living Economic System” is the economic engine for massive social change, which revitalizing Mother Earth and Global Economies; it is also connected to the World Heritage Sanctuaries, and c) Mother Earth Network (Software Platform): “Synergy” is a decentralized blockchain technology that can provide the following services: payment processing, paying rewards, running Smart Contracts, running Computer Applications, calculating Ecological Footprint, monetizing Assets, and Medical Research.

(a) Fuel: The Earth Dollar is an asset backed complementary currency, that is decentralized, non-inflationary, and uses blockchain technology. While the Earth Dollar is independent of any political affiliations, borders or nation-states, the Earth Dollar is also the national currency of some indigenous nations, and the legal complementary currency of some local governments.

What is the real value of protecting nature, which gives us life? Billions of dollars in estimated publicized natural capital from our World Heritage Sanctuaries have been pledged on the blockchain to be protected and backed by the currency under a global commons; these assessments will be autonomously verified and is expected to be completed by the Fall of 2016, by applying the Natural Capital Accounting System (NCA).

Indigenous Nations and property owners have pledged their assets on the blockchain from the following regions:

    North America – 3 regions
    Africa – 2 regions

The Fall 2016 Accounting Report to be done for asset evaluation will include as follows: (Land cover map and geospatial database by land cover classification of all lands, natural resources, ecosystem services, and areas of significance for traditional use; Carbon budget and GHG emissions assessment and map; Marketable Natural Resource Asset valuation, highest and best-use analysis of natural capital; Ecosystem services valuations for 18 ecosystem services; Traditional Land Use Mapping and Valuation; Human Industrial Footprint and Industrial Disturbance analysis and loss to traditional values: Estimated economic/cultural (TLU)/ecological costs of damages incurred from human/industrial impact; Completion of a Natural Capital Asset Balance Sheet and Valuations for the Earth Dollar to inform strategic decision making)

(b) Economic Engine: The Earth Dollar is designed to Heal Our Mother Earth (H.O.M.E.), by running a parallel economic system based on the wellness of Mother Earth. The Earth Dollar also mitigate the effects of climate injustice, helps to further the goal of ending global poverty, can revitalize our global economies and able to resolve some of the world’s biggest problems. The Earth Dollar works in alongside national currencies, and complementary currencies.

The world is getting more interconnected, and global problems such as climate injustice, pollution, collapsing economies, poverty, and war require global collaborative solutions. The world already has many solutions, but “there isn’t enough money” to implement them. While the world spends about over $1.7 trillion annually on war, it “does not have” $30 billion per year to feed the millions of people dying from hunger every year. We could convert all our homes to solar power, but “it is too expensive”. There is “not enough funding” to reverse climate injustice… “not enough money” to provide clean water to all the world’s population… The scarcity of money is a man-made problem and the Earth Dollar can provide a way to funnel the power of money into the solutions.

(c) Mother Earth Network (Software Platform): The Mother Earth Network (Software Platform) is a decentralized blockchain consensus technology that is cloned from an upgraded and modified version of Ethereum, which runs the “Living Economic System”. Synergy will provide the following services: payment processing, paying rewards, running Smart Contracts, running Computer Applications, calculating Ecological Footprint, monetizing Assets, and Medical Research. The Mother Earth Network (Software Platform) is being developed into a decentralized super computer.

We hope to use the Earth Dollar to redefine wealth, success and prosperity by creating a monetary system and economic system centered around the preservation life. We believe the Earth Dollar will also be central in the creation of the world’s largest climate action fund. Unlike other traditional currencies that are created by issuing debt, the Earth Dollar is debt free because it is created via assets.
